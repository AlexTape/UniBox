# Concept

The UniBox Server is implementing different type of messages.
```java
    public enum MessageType {
        CHAT,
        ERROR,
        GAME,
        SYSTEM
    }
```
Each message type has itÂ´s own prediction. The following routes are able to deliver different kinds of messages around the registered clients. Please read carefully if you want to deliver messages beside the default messaging functions derived by the Client API or overwrite the default functionality of the frontend javascript app.
