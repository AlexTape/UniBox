# Introduction

## Why UniBox?

The UniBox project connects various gaming clients via network. Basically it consists of a Servlet-Server linked to a mysql database (storing user data, rankings), an easy to user client API and a core library, to cover cross-package dependencies.

## UniBox Server

The Server is providing a web-frontend to get a quick overview of the current running game sessions. Furthermore there is a chat functionality which is mostly intended to permit a communication between online/registered players before they joined an enclosed game channel.
