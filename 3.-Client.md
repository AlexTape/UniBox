# Client Guide

The UserBoxClient provides a User API.

To get in touch with the service and to play your JavaFX game against another remote player you first have to get valid credentials from your administrator. After that you can login into the backend dashboard to change your default password.

The Dashboard displays all available game channels and the current result statistics. Furthermore you can create new game channels and chat with other remote players via the chat tab.

NOTE: The backend is fully responsive, so you can even use it with your smartphone or tablet as a simple but functional chat system.
