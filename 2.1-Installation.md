# Installation

Follow these few steps to deploy unibox.

## Deploy database

To setup the MySQL database launch phpMyAdmin (or similar tool) to create a new database and inject both sql scripts in the right order.

1. [Create Script](https://github.com/AlexTape/UniBox/blob/master/UniBoxServer/WebContent/WEB-INF/database/UniBoxCreate.sql)

2. [Insert Script](https://github.com/AlexTape/UniBox/blob/master/UniBoxServer/WebContent/WEB-INF/database/UniBoxInserts.sql)

## Deploy WAR file

First of all you need the WAR File. After downloading, you can copy the WAR file to you Tomcat webapps folder.

```
%CATALINA_HOME%\webapps
```

**IMPORTANT: rename "UniBoxServer.war" to "UniBox.war" !**


After that, start Tomcat (i.e. run the Tomcat startup script).

```
%CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup.bat
```

Your WAR file will be automatically stripped to a folder that has the same name (without extension).

```
%CATALINA_HOME%\UniBoxServer\
```

Take a look at the Tomcat configuration and note the port for the HTTP-Connector.

```
%CATALINA_HOME%\conf\server.xml
```

The default value is 8080.

```
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
		   connectionTimeout="20000"
		   redirectPort="8443" />
```

## Good job!

Access the following URL

```
http://localhost:port/UniBoxServer/
```

Initial Admin Credentials:

```
User:       Admin
Password:   user
```
