The UserBoxClient is providing a User API.

To get in touch with the service and to play your JavaFX game against another remote player you first have to get valid credentials by your administrator. After that you can login into the backend dashboard to change your default password.

The Dashboard is displaying all available game channels and the current result statistics. Furhtermore you can create new game channels and chat with other remote players via the chat tab.

NOTE: The backend is fully responsible, so you can even use it with your smartphone or tablet as a simple but functional chat system.
