# Synchron Requests
## Login Mask
```
Type:           GET|POST
URL:            /Login
Parameter:      error=[STRING]
ContentType:    text/html
Realm:          public
```
This Route is forward handle to /login.html which is a static page serving the login formular. If anything went really wrong while using the webservice you will be redirected to this screen and a error will be attached as a value for the error parameter.

## Request Connection Cookie
```
Type:           POST
URL:            /Communicator
                /JavaScript
                /Serial
Parameter:      action=connect
                nick=[STRING]
                password[BASE64_STRING]
Output:         text/html
Realm:          registered
```
This request is able to promote a new user as a SYSTEM Message (e.g. "User XY joined.."). No matter which of these three available urls you call to promote your login, the result will be the same. Basically this method can be used to retrieve a cookie without visiting the login mask.

**NOTE:** All registered requests are able to authorize you if the request contains nick and password parameters. But in case of the performance issue it is much better to store the received cookie after the first request you do to get instant access without claiming the authorize routine each time again and again.

## Sending Messages

The UniBox Server is implementing different type of messages.
```java
package de.unibox.core.network.object;

/**
 * The Enum MessageType.
 */
public enum CommunicatorMessageType {

    /** The chat. */
    CHAT,

    /** The error. */
    ERROR,

    /** The game. */
    GAME,

    /** The js command. */
    JS_COMMAND,

    /** The ping. */
    PING,

    /** The system. */
    SYSTEM,

    /** The plain. */
    PLAIN
}
```
Each message type has itÂ´s own prediction. The following routes are able to deliver different kinds of messages around the registered clients. Please read carefully if you want to deliver messages beside the default messaging functions derived by the Client API or overwrite the default functionality of the frontend javascript app.
### Plain Message
```
Type:           POST
URL:            /Communicator
Parameter:      action=push
                message=[STRING]
Output:         text/html
Realm:          registered
```
This route can be used to push plain messages. The concrete message content will be specified within the message parameter value. If anything went wrong you will get a 422 Http-State. Plain Messages are currently forwareded to all registered clients. Recommended usage would be a base64 encoded message string even if each client has to encode the string itself.

**NOTE:** Right now neither the Client API nor the Dashboard is using PLAIN Messages. It is currently just a kind of generic message which is basically not needed in the UniBox Lifecycle.

### Javascript Message
```
Type:           POST
URL:            /Communicator/JavaScript
Parameter:      action=push
                message=[STRING]
Output:         text/html
Realm:          registered
```
This route is used to push a new javascript message. The concrete message content will be specified within the message parameter value. If anything went wrong you will get a 422 Http-State. Javascript Messages are forwarded as CHAT Messages. These Messages will be broadcasted to all Dashboard Clients immediatly.

### Serial Message
```
Type:           POST
URL:            /Communicator/Serial
Parameter:      action=push
                message=[STRING]
Output:         text/html
Realm:          registered
```
This route is used to push serial message.  The concrete message content will be specified within the message parameter value. The whole Communication Object will get serialized and transmitted. If anything went wrong you will get a 422 Http-State. Serial Messages can be any [type of message](http://alextape.github.io/UniBox/JavaDoc/UniBoxCore/de/unibox/core/network/object/CommunicatorMessageType.html) and will be forwarded to all clients connected through the UniBox API.

**NOTE:** Serial Messages will NOT be forwarded to any Dashboard Client.
